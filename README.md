# Bad Arduino Penetration Testing Tool Kit

The Bad Arduino PenTesting Tool Kit is a ready-to-go script repo allowing users to make functioning pentesting hardware in minutes such as RFID Badge Cloners to Noise Makers and anything in between.

## Features

### Arduino
* RFID Badge Cloner
* RFID Badge Cloner w/ LCD Display
* Buzzer and LED Distraction
* CCTV UV/IR Masker

### P4wnP1 ALOA
* RubberDucky HID Scripts
  * File_Thief - Copy files to storage
  * Net_Share - Begin network share of C:\ drive
  * Reverse_TCP - Runs payload (Reverse TCP Stager) from pastebin raw source in powershell back to host

### Raspberry Pi
* RPi Motion Detection Surveillance Camera

### Windows OS
* Google-Speech-AI

## Getting Started

To begin, install Arduino for your OS (Win, Lin, OSX), then git, and then run ``` git clone https://github.com/Cisc0-gif/Bad-Arduino.git ``` to clone the repo.
